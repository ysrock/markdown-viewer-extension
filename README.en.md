# Markdown Viewer

Write your documents in Markdown and export a polished Word file with one click.

## 💡 What problems does this tool solve?

Have you ever run into these headaches?

- ✍️ **Markdown is efficient to write, but Word is required for delivery** – enterprise collaboration, academic submissions, and project handoffs still demand Word documents.
- 📊 **Flowcharts and sequence diagrams do not survive the journey** – Mermaid code does not render in Word, so you end up taking manual screenshots.
- 🤯 **Screenshot, paste, resize… repeat forever** – every edit forces you to capture the diagram again; a single document can mean dozens of repetitive steps.
- 😵 **Copying into Word destroys the layout** – heading hierarchy breaks, table styling disappears, and you spend ages fixing the formatting.
- 📐 **Math formulas are painful to convert** – LaTeX pasted into Word turns into plain text and no longer displays correctly.

Now you only need to press one button and all of these issues disappear.

## ✨ What you can do with this tool

### 📝 Focus on writing and forget formatting troubles

Write your content in Markdown:
- Technical design documents
- Product requirement documents
- Course notes
- Academic papers
- API references

When you are done, press the **Download** button and instantly receive a perfectly formatted Word file.

**No more:**
- ❌ Manual screenshots
- ❌ Copy and paste loops
- ❌ Hand-tuning the layout
- ❌ Worrying about diagrams not showing up

**Handled automatically:**
- ✅ Flowcharts and sequence diagrams converted to high-definition images
- ✅ Math formulas transformed into native, editable Word equations
- ✅ Heading levels and list indentation preserved exactly
- ✅ Syntax-highlighted code blocks ready for technical review

### 🎯 Built to solve real-world problems

**Scenario 1: Technical documentation must be delivered in Word**

You are preparing a system architecture document with a dozen flowcharts and sequence diagrams. In the past you had to:
1. Draw every diagram in draw.io or another tool
2. Export the diagram as an image
3. Insert it into Word
4. Adjust size and position
5. Repeat everything after each revision

Now you only need to:
1. Describe the diagrams with Mermaid code in Markdown
2. Click the download button

You save around 90% of the effort.

**Scenario 2: Academic papers packed with formulas**

You are writing a paper containing dozens of equations. Previously you had to:
1. Type every formula again in Word’s equation editor
2. Or rely on services such as Mathpix (and pay for it)

Now you can:
1. Write the formulas in Markdown with standard LaTeX syntax
2. Click download and the equations become editable Word math objects

It is faster, cleaner, and free.

**Scenario 3: Teams collaborate in Markdown but must share Word files**

Your team keeps documentation in Markdown inside a Git repository, yet management or clients still expect Word reports. Previously you had to:
1. Copy everything into Word by hand
2. Recreate the formatting
3. Capture screenshots for diagrams

Now you just:
1. Open the Markdown file
2. Click download
3. Send the generated document

The very same report is ready in under a minute.

### 📖 Preview as you write and guarantee perfect exports

Open any Markdown file to see the final look immediately:

**Even large files load in seconds**
- Packed with dozens of complex diagrams? It still opens instantly.
- Text appears right away, while diagrams render in the background.
- Reopening the same document uses the cache and becomes even faster.

**Tweak the view at any time**
- 🔍 Flexible zoom (50%–400%)
  - Need larger text? Zoom in without limits.
  - Working on a small screen? Zoom out for the big picture.
  - Reset to default with a single click.
- 📐 Three layout modes to preview exports
  - Normal (1000 px) for the best reading width in the browser
  - Fullscreen for presentations and meetings
  - Narrow (530 px) to mimic Word pagination ahead of time
- 📑 Hundreds of pages? Use the sidebar TOC to jump to any section instantly.
- 💾 Your reading position is remembered automatically so you resume where you left off.

**The more you use it, the faster it gets**
- The first load initializes the rendering engine in a few seconds.
- Subsequent opens of the same document show diagrams and formulas immediately.
- Repeated loading time drops dramatically.
